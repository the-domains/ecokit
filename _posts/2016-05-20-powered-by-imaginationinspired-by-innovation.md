# Powered by imagination.Inspired by innovation.

Ecokit is affordable, versatile, easy to assemble, zero energy kit home, with minimal operating costs and positive environmental impact.

It is the real (and cool) alternative to conventional constructions, remarkable by its nonconformist architecture and bright, healthy indoor environment. The house is designed to take advantage of renewable energy sources (solar energy, hydroelectricity, etc.) -- to be kind to our environment and your pocket -- imagine life without energy bills!

This premium organic home connects the concept of comfort and coziness with the functionality of a modern, ecological, elegant home.
