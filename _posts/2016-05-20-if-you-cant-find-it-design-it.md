### "If you can't find it, design it."

This motto was the starting engine to the process of designing & developing the concept of ecokit. With a help of a skilled architect and engineer, we have transformed the dream of an affordable home than anyone can build into a beautiful, contemporary and functional home.

The result is a new standardized house within reach of most people. An uncomplicated, cost- and energy-efficient design that is easy to build and customize. But also a stunning building with generous natural light and a feeling of space throughout the house.

### Inspired by you

We believe that designing and building your home can be one of the best experiences of your life. And if you put together skills, technology, hard work, commitment and willingness anything is possible.

The ecokit construction process goes easy on everything except quality, beauty, and functionality. We want the planet to be as happy as our customers are! We use the most planet friendly, high quality materials to build beautiful, efficient, comfortable homes that fit your modern lifestyle.
